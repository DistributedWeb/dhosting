      <h3>1.1</h3>
      <p>
        Your use of the dHosting service is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "Distributed Webs Project, LLC." means Distributed Webs Project, LLC. Inc., and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the dHosting Service. The “dHosting Services” means the services Distributed Webs Project, LLC. makes available through this website, including this website, dHosting API, and any other software or services offered by Distributed Webs Project, LLC. in connection to any of those.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2</h3>
      <p>
        In order to use the dHosting Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the dHosting Services. You understand and agree that Distributed Webs Project, LLC. will treat your use of the dHosting Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3</h3>
      <p>
        You may not use the dHosting Services if you are a person barred from receiving the dHosting Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the dHosting Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the dHosting Services are not intended for children under 13.
      </p>

      <h3>1.4</h3>
      <p>
        You agree your purchases of dHosting Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Distributed Webs Project, LLC. or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

      <h3>2.1</h3>
